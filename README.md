## Zanim

This is a basic animation engine inspired by 3blue1brown's [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) made in zig.

I made this as an exercise to learn Zig. It uses OpenGL to view the animation. Currently, it doesn't support generating video files.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what the engine can do. You can run the examples locally with the given command.

### Cube
